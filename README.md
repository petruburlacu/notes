                        Entrepreneur Report


Background information
William Henry Gates, born on October 28, 1955, is an American business magnate, author, philanthropist, humanitarian and principal founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the position of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.
Company started 
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world`s largest PC software company. Gates led the company as chief executive officer until stepping down in January 2000. In June 2006 Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a full-time position at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000. 
He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive.
Why they started 
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard. He spent a lot of time using the school`s computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974. The new computer was based on the Intel CPU. Allen and Gates saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company, Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time, he explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying ``…if things [Microsoft] hadn`t worked out, I could always go back to school…``
Business information 
Microsoft`s Altair Basic was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had backed into the company and was being widely copied and distributed. During Microsoft`s early year, all employees had board responsibility for the company`s business. Gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, according to Bill Gates own claims, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.
Microsoft expended into applications software and continued to grow unchecked until 1984, when Apple introduced the first Macintosh computer. The Macintosh`s sleek graphical user interface (GUI) was far easier to use than MS-DOS and threatened to make Microsoft program obsolete. In response to this thread, Gates announced that Microsoft was developing its own GUI-based operating system called Windows. Gates than took Microsoft public in 1985 to generate capital. When Windows was finally released in 1986, it wasn`t exactly the breakthrough Gates had predicted.
